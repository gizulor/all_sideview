<p><strong>all_sideview</strong> adds a toggle which displays the public view of the current article.</p>

<p>Sideview displays if your screen is large enough, and updates every time you save your article. </p>

<p>If you want to exclude a section from Sideview, specify it at the beginning of the Javascript block (around line 60): <code>const sectionExcluded = &#39;yoursectionname&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <strong>jakob</strong> who did the heavy lifting in converting my code to a plugin.</p>

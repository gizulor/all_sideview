*all_sideview* adds a toggle which displays the public view of the current article.

Sideview displays if your screen is large enough, and updates every time you save your article. 

If you want to exclude a section from Sideview, specify it at the beginning of the Javascript block (around line 60): @const sectionExcluded = 'yoursectionname'@.
